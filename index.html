<p>Hi and welcome to my page.  My name is Stephanie Scane.  I have a Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Studies, a Master's Degree in Forest Conservation and now I am working on completing a Post-Grad Diploma from Fleming College in Geographic Information Systems. 
This is where I'll write a short introduction about myself and my schooling--
where I've gone, and why I've chosen the path I have.
