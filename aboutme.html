<p> Throughout my life, I have always had an appreciation for wildlife and the outdoors.  Whether I was catching frogs or collecting snails, I was always outside.
So, when it was time to make the decision of what I wanted to pursue for my career, I decided on Environmental Studies at the University of Windsor.  I chose this university not only because I 
was offered a spot on the Windsor Lancer's Track and Field team but also because it was in my hometown.</p>
  
 <!-- Here I just wanted to provide a brief sumamry of what this page is about aand just introduce my educational history-->
<p> I am extremely grateful for the opportunities that I have been given throughout my education and work experiences as they have helped shape the person I am today.</p>
  
<p class= "aboutme"> Bachelor of Environmental Studies, Univeristy of Windsor (2014-2018)</p> <!-- I wanted to have two separate subheadings for my degrees to highlight them on their own-->
<!-- my education is an important part of who I am so I want to give a good understanding and summary of what I learned, in addition to the link I provided for the program website-->
<p> My Bachlor of Environmental Studies degree introduced me to many of the broad topics in the environmental sector.  I took many courses ranging from hydrology and climatology to Urban and Sustainable Agriculture.
This has given me a very strong foundational understanding of these broad concepts and has allowed me to develop areas of interest that I wanted to build upon, whether for career purposes or just side hobbies.
I was able to take an internship with the Dean of Science to plan and prepare an environmental showcase that highlight the Invasive and Native Species in the Great Lakes.  Unfortunately due to time constraints, the physical showcase was unable to 
take place but I gained valuable planning and researching skills when interviewing professors for important subjects to highlight.

<p class= "aboutme"> Master of Forest Conservation, University of Toronto (2018-2020)</p> <!-- I wanted to have two separate subheadings for my degrees to highlight them on their own-->
 <!-- my education is an important part of who I am so I want to give a good understanding and summary of what I learned, in addition to the link I provided for the program website-->
<p> Nearing completion of my Bachelor's Degree I knew I wanted to pursue a post graduate degree, so after researching programs, I decided that I wanted to pursue Forest Conservation because wildlife and environmental conservation are very important to me.
    This program combined the things that I was (and still am) passionate about and added an extra element of forestry, which made a substantial impact on how I view life itself and my career moving forward.
    Additionally, this course gave me hands-on experience through 3 separate field-camps in Haliburton, ON., Mattawa, ON., and Ecuador. In Haliburton, I learned valuable hands-on stills for data collection of various subjects of interest (small mammals, fungi, insects, vegetation)
    and this widend my understanding of best-practices in the field of forestry. To go my Gallery page to see pictures of myself handling an Southern Flying Squirrel and also some logs after they had been harvested.
    In Mattawa, we learned about forestry practices during the winter and were able to witness machinery at work. Finally, I was lucky enough to participate in the international field camp where we travelled to several locations accross Ecuador
    where I was able to experience international forestry operations, participate in a 24 hour research blitz in the Amazonian Rainforest and hike the beautiful Chimborazo and surrounding areas.  To see pictures from this field camp see my Gallery page. Overall, I learned many valuable skills here
    and I am eager to extend this knowledge further.

<p class= "aboutme"> Hobbies and Interests</p> <!-- I think hobbies are important to highlight because it adds depth to applicants and shows that they are more than just their education and work experiences-->
<p> While I am a fan of the outdoors, there are a couple specific activities that I try my best to participate in whenever the opportunity comes my way.  These are: golfing and exploring natural/greenspaces with my dog.  
Living in Windsor has afforded me the small luxary of having many options for different golf courses available for me to challenge my skills.  While I am still relatively new to the sport, I find that it is a great way to be active outside and test my mental game.</p>

<p> Windsor also has a few beautiful areas that I frequent with my dog which are Ojibway Provincial Park, Malden Park and the Windsor Waterfront.  If I have time, we will venture to Point Pelee National Park in Leamington and spend the day here, one of my absolute favourite walking places. </p>
<!-- I think Windsor can have a bad-reputation depending on who you talk to, so I wanted to make sure to add a nice comment about what it has to offer.-->
