<p id= "AboutMe">About Me</p>

<p> Throughout my life, I have always had an appreciation for wildlife and the outdoors.  Whether I was catching frogs or collecting snails, I was always outside.
So, when it was time to make the decision of what I wanted to pursue for my career, I decided on Environmental Studies at the University of Windsor.  I chose this university not only because I 
was offered a spot on the Windsor Lancer's Track and Field team but also because it was in my hometown.*** (change this around and also maybe move this to the homepage)</p>
 <p> I am extremely grateful for the opportunities that I have been given throughout my education and work experiences as they have helped shape the person I am today.</p>
<p class= "aboutme"> Bachelor of Environmental Studies, Univeristy of Windsor (2014-2018)</p>

<p class= "aboutme"> Master of Forest Conservation, University of Toronto (2018-2020)</p>

<p> While I am a fan of the outdoors, there are a couple specific activities that I try my best to participate in whenever the opportunity comes my way.  These are: golfing and exploring natural/greenspaces with my dog.  
Living in Windsor has afforded me the small luxary of having many options for different golf courses available for me to challenge my skills.  While I am still relatively new to the sport, I find that it is a great way to be active outside and test my mental game.</p>

<p> Windsor also has a few beautiful areas that I frequent with my dog which are Ojibway Provincial Park, Malden Park and the Windsor Waterfront.  If I have time, we will venture to Point Pelee National Park in Leamington and spend the day here, one of my absolute favourite walking places. </p>
