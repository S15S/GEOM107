  <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li><!-- I called the main page "home" because to me that is a very generalized and universal term for the mainpage of a website-->
  <li><a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a></li><!-- I wanted a separate page to highlight my education and educational experience so that it was more organized and easily accessible-->

<p id= "Gallery">Gallery</p> <!-- I wanted a specific photogallery because I know that when I visit websites, I like when all of the pictures are in one specific location again for organization-->
<p> Through my education, I have been given the opportunity to attend several field camps giving me various degrees of hands-on experience. </p>
<p> Here, I would like to showcase some of these experiences through pictures I captured along the way. </p>
